# RouteX

If this is your first time, skip the first three steps:

    Make a backup somewhere of the Routex folder.
    Now remove the RouteX repository in Git.
    Then clone it again.
    Now that it opens in your browser, take the files (wp-admin, wp-includes, etc.) from before.
    Except for .gitignore, wp-content, and README, do not touch these three!!!
    Also, work in a separate branch, do not commit directly to main. Once you finish everything, then merge. Respect!

PLEASE DO NOT TAKE .gitignore FROM BEFORE!!!
